## This is a prototype script which will replace logstash-grok-hpaws.conf when it works
## This grok setup will not take into account elasticsearch analyzers for the time being
## The output and logs this script will eventually tackle will include
## tcpdump logs (from converted pcaps), apache2 logs, dionaea logs/output, kippo logs/output, bro logs, cuckoo logs and analyses, and misc.
## apache2... tested... works great!
input {
  file {
    type => "apache"
    path => ["/var/log/apache2/access.log", "/var/log/apache2/error.log"]
  }
## syslog... tested, works.
  file {
    type => "syslog"
    path => [ "/var/log/*.log", "/var/log/messages", "/var/log/syslog" ]
  }
## lumberjack, now known as logstash forwarder... not tested
