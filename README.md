Lucid Nonsense
========================

Repo for the Advanced Malware Detection Platform. This platform, which currently is being built under the name Lucid Nonsence - Advanced Intellegence Analysis Platform,
is being built and designed to provide automated malware and other threat analyses for: 1) Data Analysis of Malware and Attackers 2) automated preliminary analysis 3) platform that can be reconfigured as an alert system or network monitoring supplimentary system.

This will be done so as to setup the entire system, including maintinance requirements, so a small group or even a single person can mantain this system while still benefitting from all the functionality, power and efficency that other systems similar to this allow.
