## this is the first attempt at creating a functioning logstash file in order to find and parse information within logs
## for elasticsearch
## This grok setup will not take into account elasticsearch analyzers for the time being
## The output and logs this script will eventually tackle will include
## pcaps, apache2 logs, dionaea logs/output, kippo logs/output, bro logs, cuckoo logs and analyses, and misc.
